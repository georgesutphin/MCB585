MCB585: Multidisciplinary/Quantitative Approaches to Solving Biological Problems
================================================================================

MCB585 is an advanced graduate course focused on quantitative approaches to biological questions. Students will learn how to acquire, access, and interact with large biological datasets. The course relies heavily on learning and utilizing the R Statistical Programming language and UNIX/HPC environment, but students are not expected to have programming experience upon entering the course. The course is broken into two units. The first unit will focus on introducing R and using R in common statistical operations. This section incorporates elements of experimental design and appropriate application of statistical tests as a framework for learning R. The second unit will focus on analyzing functional genomic and high-throughput data with an introduction to bioinformatics, machine learning, and data integration. In the second unit we will use the analysis of next-generation RNA-sequencing data as a leading example and apply statistical models based on the first section to uncover related gene pathways and networks.

The basic design of the course presentation is based on [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), which teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. The couse instructors are:

* [George Sutphin](https://sutphinlab.org/) (sutphin@arizona.edu)
* [Guang Yao](https://sites.arizona.edu/yao-lab/) (guangyao@arizona.edu)
