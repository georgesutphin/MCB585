## In Class

### Basic Data Types in R

R uses a variety of data types, which define the properties of the value stored in a variable. The three data types that you will use most commonly are **character** (text strings), **logical** (TRUE/FALSE values), and **numeric** (decimal or "double" numeric values) objects. For the most part, the data type of a variable is detected by the format of the value assigned:


~~~
char1 <- "hello!" # "character" is your basic text string data type
num1 <- 20.5 # "numeric" is your most general data type for real, decimal numbers
logic1 <- TRUE # "logical" data type is a simply binary: TRUE or FALSE
logic2 <- F # T or F also work
~~~
{: .language-r}

&nbsp;

Use the `class()` function to determine the of a variable:


~~~
class(char1)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(num1)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "numeric"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(logic1)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "logical"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;
#### Character Variables

The **character** data type is used to store basic textual information. A character vector is defined by text in quotes (`""`). You can include most forms of text:


~~~
greeting <- "How are you today?"
equation <- "1 + 3 - 2 = 2"
~~~
{: .language-r}

&nbsp;

The major exception is the backslash (`\`), which R uses as an escape character. In computing, an escape character is a *metacharacter* that is not interpreted literally, but instead causes the computer to interpret *the character following the escape character* in a different way.


~~~
escape <- "This string \does not compute."
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error: '\d' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting ""This string \d"
~~~
{: .error}

&nbsp;

Note that the error message is complaining about the `\d`, not just the `\`. Many characters invoke specific behavior when preceded by the `\` which can be useful depending on your goals. For example, `\n` is interpreted as a *line break*:


~~~
two.lines <- "Line 1\nLine 2"
writeLines(two.lines)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Line 1
Line 2
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

This can be useful when you are trying to add text to a chart but want the text to appear on separate lines. Some functions just display the string verbatim, instead of trying to interpret the escape characters:


~~~
print(two.lines)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Line 1\nLine 2"
~~~
{: .output}
&nbsp;

As you might expect, you can't perform numeric operations on characters:


~~~
2 * two.lines
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in 2 * two.lines: non-numeric argument to binary operator
~~~
{: .error}
&nbsp;

You can also successfully print a backslash (`\`) by typing a double backslash (`\\`), which is effectively using the first `\` to "escape" the second `\`:


~~~
writeLines("Single\\backslash.")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Single\backslash.
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

There are many functions for manipulating character data types. Two examples are `paste()`, which combines text strings into a single variable separated by spaces (`paste0()` does the same without the spaces):


~~~
paste("Hello","world!")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Hello world!"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
paste0("Hello-","world!")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Hello-world!"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

`sub()` allows you to replace a defined portion of a text string:


~~~
cat.person <- "I love cats!"
cat.person
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "I love cats!"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
dog.person <- sub("cats", "dogs", cat.person)
dog.person
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "I love dogs!"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;
#### Numeric Variables

The **numeric** data type is your most common tool for storing quantitative real numbers:


~~~
dozen <- 12
dozen
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 12
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
e <- exp(1) # exp is a function that defines the constant e to a given power
e
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2.718282
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
negatives <- -3.5
negatives
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] -3.5
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

We have already looked at two of many, many functions that manipulate numeric variables:


~~~
sum(dozen, e, negatives)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 11.21828
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
sqrt(e)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1.648721
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

Some character functions automatically treat numbers (e.g. `12`) as the character equivalent (`"12"`):


~~~
sub("2","4",dozen)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "14"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

While others do not:


~~~
writeLines(dozen)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in writeLines(dozen): can only write character objects
~~~
{: .error}

&nbsp;

Just try them to find out!

&nbsp;
### Logical Variables

The **logical** data type is used to store basic TRUE vs. FALSE data:


~~~
this.is.true <- TRUE
this.is.true
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
this.is.false <- F
this.is.false
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] FALSE
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

These are useful for asking R questions about your data. For example, we can compare relative values:


~~~
x <- 4
y <- 5
x < y
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

This is useful for making decisions, with an `if` statement for example:


~~~
test1 <- T
test2 <- F
if(test1) "Test 1 is TRUE!"
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Test 1 is TRUE!"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
if(test2) "Test 2 is TRUE!"
~~~
{: .language-r}

&nbsp;
The code following the if statement will only execute if the variable or statement entered in the `()` is `TRUE`. We will talk more about how to use `if` statements later in the course.

***
### Data Structures

Elements of these data types may be combined to form data structures--collections of individual datum. There are many data structure in R, for example: 
* factors
* atomic vectors (aka vectors)
* lists
* matrices
* data frames

Here we will discuss the two most basic data structures: **vectors** and **matrices**. In later lessons we will discuss two advanced data structure, **data frames** (the most common data storage structure in R) and **lists**. **Factors** are a type of data structure, but function more like an advanced data type. You will explore **factors** in detail *On Your Own*.  

&nbsp;
#### Vectors

A vector is the most common and basic data structure in R. Vectors are also the major workhorse data structure of R. Technically, vectors can be one of two types:

* atomic vectors
* lists

However, the term "vector" most commonly refers to the atomic types and not to lists. Here we will examine atomic vectors (hereafter just called "vectors"). Lists have a critical place R as well, and will be the topic of a future lesson.

&nbsp;
#### The Different Vector Modes

A vector is a collection of elements that are most commonly of mode `character`, `logical`, `integer` or `numeric`.

You can create an empty vector with the `vector()` function. By default, the mode is `logical`, but you can be more explicit using additional arguments, as shown in the examples below. A simpler solution is to just directly construct vectors of the desired mode using on of several available functions, such as `character()`, `numeric()`, etc.


~~~
vector() # an empty 'logical' (the default) vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
logical(0)
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
vector("character", length = 5) # a vector of mode 'character' with 5 elements
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "" "" "" "" ""
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
character(5) # the same thing, but using the direct constructor function
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "" "" "" "" ""
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
numeric(5)   # a numeric vector with 5 elements
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0 0 0 0 0
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
logical(5)   # a logical vector with 5 elements
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

You can also create vectors by directly specifying their content. R will then guess the appropriate mode of storage for the vector based on your input data. To do this, you use the function `c()` (which stands for "combine"):


~~~
# numeric vector
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
class(x)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "numeric"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

The `c()` function is the most common way to define a vector of values for manipulation. We will use it frequently throughout this course, and it will be one of the functions that you use the most in your own analyses.

Directly specifying `TRUE` and `FALSE` will create a vector of mode `logical`:


~~~
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
class(y)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "logical"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

While quoted text will create a vector of mode `character`:


~~~
z <- c("Sarah", "Tracy", "Jon")
class(z)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# adding quotes to numbers forces a character vector
x.char <- c("1", "2", "3")
class(x.char)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;
#### Adding Elements

The function `c()` can also be used to add elements to a vector:


~~~
z <- c(z, "Annette")
z
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Sarah"   "Tracy"   "Jon"     "Annette"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
z <- c("Greg", z)
z
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Greg"    "Sarah"   "Tracy"   "Jon"     "Annette"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

Note that order matters and defines the order in the output vector. `c()` treats any argument that is a vector as just another set of elements in the list.

&nbsp;
#### Vectors from a Sequence of Numbers

Use the `seq()` function or the `:` operator to create a vector as a sequence of numbers.


~~~
seq(10)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
1:10
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
~~~
{: .output}

&nbps;

Check out the help documentation for the `seq()` function (`?seq`) to see what arguments we are providing and what arguments are being set to defaults. By specifying `from`, `to`, and `by` we can customize our output vector:


~~~
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.1)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6  1.7  1.8  1.9  2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3  2.4
[16]  2.5  2.6  2.7  2.8  2.9  3.0  3.1  3.2  3.3  3.4  3.5  3.6  3.7  3.8  3.9
[31]  4.0  4.1  4.2  4.3  4.4  4.5  4.6  4.7  4.8  4.9  5.0  5.1  5.2  5.3  5.4
[46]  5.5  5.6  5.7  5.8  5.9  6.0  6.1  6.2  6.3  6.4  6.5  6.6  6.7  6.8  6.9
[61]  7.0  7.1  7.2  7.3  7.4  7.5  7.6  7.7  7.8  7.9  8.0  8.1  8.2  8.3  8.4
[76]  8.5  8.6  8.7  8.8  8.9  9.0  9.1  9.2  9.3  9.4  9.5  9.6  9.7  9.8  9.9
[91] 10.0
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

You can assign these sequences directly to a variable:


~~~
series1 <- 5:15
series1
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
series2 <- seq(from = 3, to = 8, by = 0.2)
series2
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1] 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.8 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6
[20] 6.8 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;
#### What happens when you mix types inside a vector?

R will create a resulting vector with a mode that can most easily accommodate all the elements it contains. This conversion between modes of storage is called "coercion". When R converts the mode of storage based on its content, it is referred to as "implicit coercion".

&nbsp;
#### Indexing vectors

In R, `[]` are used to index vectors and other objects. For vectors, the number entered in the `[n]` will return the nth element of the vector.


~~~
x <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f")
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x[5]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "e"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

You can also use pre-defined variables or even other vectors to index different parts of the vector:


~~~
n <- 6
range <- 2:4

x[n] # returns the 6th element, as defined by n = 6
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "f"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x[range] # returns the range of values specified by "range", in this case elements 2 to 4.
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "b" "c" "d"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

We will talk about more advanced indexing strategies later in the course.

&nbsp;
#### Vectorized operations

R has a special way of dealing with vectors when dealing with operations. We know what to expect from `1 + 1`, but what happens if you try to add two vectors?


~~~
x <- c(1,2,3)
y <- c(4,5,6)

z <- x + y
z
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 5 7 9
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

R creates a new vector in which each element the sum of the elements with the same index from x and y. In essence, R is performing 3 separate "addition" operations and combining the results into a new vector. We can mimic this behavior manually:


~~~
z1 <- x[1] + y[1]
z2 <- x[2] + y[2]
z3 <- x[3] + y[3]

z <- c(z1, z2, z3)
z
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 5 7 9
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

This process is called "vectorization". It works for most mathematical operations:

~~~
x - y
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] -3 -3 -3
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x * y
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1]  4 10 18
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x / y
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.25 0.40 0.50
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x ^ y
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1]   1  32 729
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

Many functions also behave in a vectorized manner. Take the `paste()` function, for example, which combines two or more character variables into a single variable:


~~~
# Here is the output with two strings
paste("I like", "dogs.")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "I like dogs."
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# Now let's try pasting two character vectors together:
attitude <- c("I like","I dislike","I am indifferent to")
animal <-  c("dogs.","fish.","cats.")

paste(attitude,animal)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "I like dogs."              "I dislike fish."          
[3] "I am indifferent to cats."
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

{: .callout}

### Object Attributes

R objects can have **attributes**. Attributes are metadata and part of the object. Each attribute describes a different aspect of the object. These include:

* **names** -- some objects (e.g. lists) have named elements
* **dim** -- the number of rows and columns in a matrix
* **class** -- the data type of an object
* **attributes** -- a list containing other forms of metadata of more complex objects

While technically not assigned *attributes*, you can also glean other attribute-like metadata information from objects such as length (works on vectors and lists) or number of characters (for character strings).


~~~
length(1:10)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
nchar("MCB 585")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 7
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

We will periodically use object attributes to manipulate objects throughout the course, including the next topic: matrices.

***
### Matrices

In R matrices are an extension of vectors. They are not a separate type of object but simply an atomic vector with an attribute called "dimensions", i.e. a specified number of rows and columns. As with vectors, the elements of a matrix must be of the same data type. We can use the generic `matrix()` function to build a matrix. Unlike vectors, there is no direct equivalent for each data type (e.g. `character()`). However, because matrices are really just vectors, we can use a predefined vector to build a matrix:


~~~
# first create a vector, then coerce that vector into a matrix:
v <- 1:4
m <- matrix(data = v, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

# note the difference in structure
v
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1 2 3 4
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
m
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

We can now examine the attributes of our new matrix `m`:


~~~
dim(m)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2 2
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
attributes(m)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
$dim
[1] 2 2
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp; 

Note that under the surface, R still treats `m` as a vector, so the `length()` of `v` and `m` are the same (i.e. both contain 4 elements):


~~~
length(v)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 4
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
length(m)
~~~

Matrices are a higher-order object (a vector with additional properties). Thus the `class()` function no longer tells you the data type for each element, but rather the data structure type of the entire object:


~~~
class(m)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "matrix" "array" 
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

You can check the data type of the elements of the matrix using `typeof()` or `mode()`, which give slightly different information:


~~~
typeof(m)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
mode(m)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "numeric"
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

While `class()` shows that m is a matrix, and `mode()` returns the higher-order data type **numeric**, `typeof()` shows that fundamentally the matrix is an **integer** vector.

Note that one difference between vectors and matrices is that an otherwise identical vector will return the data type of each element when you use `class()`, while the matrix is a new type of object with `class()` "matrix".

By default, matrices in R are filled column-wise:


~~~
m1 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
m1
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6
~~~
{: .output}

... unless you tell it to fill by row explicitly using the `byrow` argument:


~~~
m2 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m2
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

Another way to construct a matrix is to assign values to the `dim` attribute:


~~~
m <- 1:10

# so far m is just a vector!
m
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(m)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# defining the "dimensions" attribute automatically converts m to a matrix
dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
m
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(m)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "matrix" "array" 
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

This takes a vector and transforms it into a matrix with 2 rows and 5 columns. A third way is to bind columns or rows using `rbind()` and `cbind()` ("row bind" and "column bind", respectively). 


~~~
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
cbind(x, y)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     x  y
[1,] 1 10
[2,] 2 11
[3,] 3 12
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
rbind(x, y)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
x    1    2    3
y   10   11   12
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

Note that the vectors being bound are of the same length in this case. If the vectors are of different length, the elements of the shorter vector will be repeated to fill in the missing space:


~~~
z <- 1:10
rbind(x,z)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning in rbind(x, z): number of columns of result is not a multiple of vector
length (arg 1)
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
  [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
x    1    2    3    1    2    3    1    2    3     1
z    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;
#### Indexing matrices

Like vectors, `[]` are used to index matrices. Since matrices are, by definition, two-dimensional, use `[m,n]` to index the *m*th row and *n*th column of a matrix. The row is always specified before the `,` and the column after.


~~~
m <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
m
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
m[2, 3]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

&nbsp;

If you are only interested in indexing a specific row, but do not want to change the columns, you can just leave the column index blank (but don't forget the `,`!):


~~~
m[2,]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1]  2  4  6  8 10
~~~
{: .output}

What if we ask for an index outside the range of a matrix?


~~~
m[3,15]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in m[3, 15]: subscript out of bounds
~~~
{: .error}

&nbsp;

This error universally occurs whenever you request an invalid index to an object in R (vector, matrix, list, data frame, etc.)
