## On Your Own

### A more in-depth look at Data Types in R

To make the best of the R language, you'll need a thorough understanding of the basic data types and data structures and how to operate on them.

Data structures are important to understand because these are the primary objects you will manipulate on a day-to-day basis in R. Dealing with object conversions is one of the most common sources of frustration for beginners.

All variables in R--basic data types, vectors, matrices, data frames, lists--are **objects**. Objects have a variety of attributes that define the way they interact with functions, other objects, and operators. Understanding how different classes of objects and their attributes are organized is essential to working within the R environment. 

R has 6 basic data types. In addition to the five listed below, there is also *raw* which is rarely used and will not be discussed in this course.

* **character**: `"a"`, `"swc"`, `"MCB 585"` (the "quotes" define a character string and allow spaces to be included)
* **numeric**: `2`, `15.5` (real or decimal numbers; aka "doubles")
* **integer**: `-14L`, `2L` (the `L` tells R to store this as an integer rather than a numeric value)
* **logical**: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
* **complex**: `1+4i` (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)

We discussed the three most common data types *In Class*--**characters**, **numeric**, and **logical**. Now let's take a closer look at the remaining two.

&nbsp;
#### Integers

During the *In Class* segment, we discussed three primary data types: **character**, **numeric**, and **logical**, because these are the most commonly used. Technically, **numeric** is a data type category that contains both **doubles** (double precision, or decimal, numbers) and **integers**, though often **numeric** is used as short-hand to refer to **doubles**. If you wanted to explicitly create **integers**--the set of 0, all whole numbers (1, 2, 3, ...), and their negative inverses (-1, -2, -3, ...)--you need to add an `L` to the numeric value:

```{r}
x1 <- 1L
class(x1)
```
&nbsp;

Note that if you are not explicit with the `L`, R will convert your *integer* into a *numeric*: 

```{r}
x2 <- x1 + 4L
class(x2)
x3 <- x1 + 4
class(x3)
x4 <- x1 + 4.4
class(x4)
x5 <- 2 * x1
class(x5)
x6 <- 2L * x1
class(x6)
```

&nbsp;

R will also convert to *numeric* if you try and force a decimal value to be an *integer* by including the `L`:

```{r}
not.an.integer <- 1.2L
class(not.an.integer)
```

&nbsp;
#### Complex numbers

Complex numbers are numbers that consist of two parts, $$a + bi$$, in which $$i^2 = -1$$. Because the solution to this equation, $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$, is not a real number, $$i$$ is referred to as an *imaginary number*. In complex numbers, $$a$$ is the *real part* and $$b$$ is the *imaginary part*. 

Complex numbers are represented in R using the *complex* data type. These can be created directly or using the `complex()` function:

```{r}
c1 <- 4+3i
c1
class(c1)
c2 <- complex(real = 3, imaginary = 2.5)
c2
class(c2)
```

&nbsp;

Note that you have to define $$b$$ explicitly:

```{r}
c3 <- 1+i
c3 <- 1+1i
```

&nbsp;

Complex numbers can be manipulated with operators and functions:

```{r}
2*c3
c1 + c3
c2^2
sum(c1, c3)
```

&nbsp;

Adding *numeric* values to a *complex* variable results in a *complex* variable:

```{r}
c4 <- c1 + 10
c4
class(c4)
```

&nbsp;

Both *integer* or *complex* data types are necessary for certain types of analysis. Know they exist and how to deal with them if they come up in one of your applications.

&nbsp;
#### Converting between data types

You can shift between data types using the `as.` functions:

```{r}
n1 <- 42
n1.as.char <- as.character(n1)
n1.as.char

# ... now check the class of the new variable:
class(n1.as.char)

# you can't add numbers to characters!
num1.as.char + 4
```

&nbsp;

It only works if the conversion makes sense in context. R also does not understand non-numeric references to numbers (e.g. using "two" to refer to the number 2). 

```{r}
# this one works:
as.numeric("44")

# these don't
as.numeric("hello!")
as.numeric("forty-four")
```

&nbsp;

Note that when one of the `as.` functions throws an error, it doesn't simply fail to return a variable. Instead it throws an error message and assigns an `NA` value to the variable. `NA` is one of several special values that represents missing data, or "Not Available". We will discuss these special characters in more detail later in this lesson.

Sometimes these functions can have unintended consequences. When we apply the `as.integer()` function to a numeric, it automatically rounds decimal number "down" (i.e. "toward 0") to the nearest integer:

```{r}
as.integer(1)
as.integer(0.1)
as.integer(1.1)
as.integer(-1.1)
as.integer(-0.9)
```

&nbsp;

The `as.logical()` function will take `0` as `FALSE` and any non-zero numeric as `TRUE`. It will throw an error for any character input that is not a common spelling of `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Note that `T` works, but `t` does not.

```{r}
as.logical(0)
as.logical(1)
as.logical(10)
as.logical(0.01)
as.logical(-4)
as.logical("TRUE")
as.logical("True")
as.logical("tRUE")
as.logical("T")
as.logical("t")
as.logical("false")
```

&nbsp;

There is a basic underlying hierarchy to data types that runs from more general (character) to more specific (integer), and conversions only tend to work in the more general direction. For additional discussion of data types in R (and many other topics), check out the [Vectors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) chapter in the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

You can also *coerce* vectors and matrices using the same functions `as.integer()`.

```{r}
num.vec <- seq(0.1,1,0.1)
class(num.vec)
int.vec <- as.integer(num.vec)
class(int.vec)
```


***
### Factors

Factors are technically a data structure but function as a special data type in R. Factors are primarily used to represent categorical data. Factors can be *ordered* or *unordered* and are an important class for statistical analysis and for plotting.

Factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, but assuming that they are character vectors can lead to unexpected behavior. Factors are actually an odd hybrid of **integers** and **characters** under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them like strings. 

Factors have three essential properties:
* A vector of *integers*.
* A set of *labels* defining a *name* corresponding to each *integer*.
* A defined *order* for the *labels* (for ordered factors).

The **integer** defines the value of each element in the factor, the *label* indicates what that value means, and the *order* defines the relationship between the values.

Once created, each element of a factor can only contain a pre-defined set values, known as or *levels*. *Labels* and *levels* essentially refer to the same thing and the terms can be used interchangeably, for the most part. The *labels* variable in the `factor()` function defines the *levels* attribute in the created **factor**. By default, R sorts *levels* in alphabetical order. For instance, let's use the `factor()` command to create a factor with 2 levels:


```{r intro-to-factors}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
sex
```

&nbsp;

Now compare this to a similar `character` vector:

```{r intro-to-factors2}
sex.char <- c("male", "female", "female", "male")
sex.char
```

&nbsp;

Note that the elements of `sex.char` have quotation marks, while the object `sex` had a list of *levels*.

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because `f` comes before `m` in the alphabet, even though the first element in this vector is `"male"`). You can check the current order using the function `levels()`, and check the number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r examining-factors}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

&nbsp;

Use the `str()` function to see both the levels ("female", "male") and the underlying **integer** representation of the factor:

```{r}
str(sex)
```

&nbsp;

Note that the order in which the *levels* appear defines which level corresponds to which integer number. 

The major functional difference between **character** and **factor** objects is that the elements of the **character** vector only have the inherent order defined by their values (e.g. alphabetical). Sometimes, the order of the **factor** elements does not matter; other times you might want to specify the order because it is meaningful. For instance, "low", "medium", "high" as elements of a character vector have the implicit alphabetical order:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"high" < "low" < "medium"

while the more meaningful conceptual ordering is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"low" < "medium" < "high"

By default, **factor** levels take on the alphabetical order:

```{r, error=TRUE}
food <- factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
```

&nbsp;

Adding the `levels` argument to `factor()` function defines the level order if you do not want it to be alphabetical:

```{r}
food <- factor(food, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
```

&nbsp;

Note that "relative" operations do not work with **factors** unless they are ordered. The function `min()` returns the minimum value in an **integer** vector, but not for either the `food` or `sex` **factor** vectors:

```{r}
n1 <- 1:10
min(n1)
min(food)
min(sex)
```

&nbsp;

Even though we entered the levels of `food` in a specific order, R does not assume that the order that we entered the strings implies relative value unless we make it explicit. We can specify relative values for *levels* using the `ordered` argument in the `factor()` (which defaults to `FALSE` if unspecified):

```{r}
food <- factor(food, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered = TRUE)
levels(food)
min(food)
```

&nbsp;

Now `class()` and `str()` both reflect the order and relative values of the levels, respectively:

```{r}
class(sex)
str(sex)
class(food)
str(food)
```

&nbsp;

Note that numeric operations still do not work, so you can't assume **factors** behave like **integers** either:

```{r}
food[1] + food[2]
```

&nbsp;

In R's memory, these factors are represented by numbers (1, 2, 3). This is better than using simple integer labels because factors are self describing:

`"low"`, `"medium"`, and `"high"`" is more descriptive than `1`, `2`, `3`. Which is low? You would not necessarily be able to tell with just integer data. Factors have this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels, such as a **factor** vector containing the unique patient identifiers for a data set containing several thousand patients.

&nbsp;
#### Adding elements to factors

For the most part, adding elements to a **factor** works similarly to adding elements to other types of vectors:

```{r}
food[8] <- "low" 
food
```

&nbsp;

Note that skipping an element introduces `NA`s in the intermediate elements. More on this later...

```{r}
food[10] <- "high" 
food
```

&nbsp;

The exception occurs when you try to add a new *level* that is not defined within the **factor**:

```{r}
food[11] <- "very high"
food
```

&nbsp;

Since the requested entry is not a valid level, R generates an `NA` instead. To add this element, we first must redefine the valid list of levels. You could use the `factor()` function with "very high" included in the `levels` argument, but a simply way is to assign the new value using the `levels()` function

```{r}
levels(food) <- c(levels(food), "very high")
levels(food)
```

&nbsp; 

Here we just used the `c()` function to append a new value onto the existing list of levels. Now we can assign the new element:

```{r}
food[11] <- "very high"
food
```


&nbsp;
#### Converting Factors

Converting from a factor to a number can cause problems:

```{r converting-factors}
f <- factor(c(3.4, 1.2, 5))
as.numeric(f)
```

&nbsp;

This does not behave as expected (and there is no warning). The reason is that the apparent numeric values are actually stored as integers (2, 1, 3) with labels ("3.4", "1.2", "5"). R uses the integer value when trying to perform the `as.numeric()` function.

The recommended way is to use the integer vector to index the factor levels:

```{r converting-factors-correctly}
levels(f)[f]
```

&nbsp;

Remember that the factor really consists of two elements:
* The ordered integer list: `2, 1, 3`
* The "key" indicating which integer corresponds to which level: `1 = "1.2"`, `2 = "3.4"`, `3 = "5"` 

To break down the `levels(f)[f]`:
1. First we grab the list of levels using `levels(f)`, which outputs a character vector: "1.2" "3.4" "5".
2. Next we index this list with `[f]`. Because the index requests a numeric representation of the factor `f`, R replaces the `[f]` with `[c(2,1,3)]` (the integer portion of the factor object).
3. R returns the elements of the character list in (1) with the order indicated by the integer list in (2).

Note that the output from `levels(f)[f]` is actually a character vector, because we indexed the list of levels (which are stored as characters). To convert value of `f` to a basic `numeric` type, we still need to assign the values output above using `<-` and the `as.numeric()`:

```{r converting-to-numeric}
f <- levels(f)[f]
f <- as.numeric(f)
f
class(f)
```

### Examining objects

R provides many functions to examine features of vectors, matrices, and other objects. A few of the most common and useful are as follows:

* `class()` - what kind of object is it (high-level)?
* `typeof()` - what is the object's data type (low-level)?
* `mode()` - returns the storage mode of an object (this will give the class of the elements of a vector or matrix).
* `length()` - how long is it/how many elements does it contain (one-dimensional objects)? 
* `dim()` - what are its dimensions (two-dimensional objects)?
* `attributes()` - does it have metadata?
* `str()` - what is the structure of the object?
* `head()` and `tail()` - what does the data look like (provide a sample from the beginning or end of the object)?

Here are a couple of examples:

```{r}
#--------------------------------------------------
# Example 1 -- a character variable object
x <- "dataset"

# These return the same information for character variables
typeof(x)
class(x)
mode(x)

# Simple objects to not have attributes by default
attributes(x) 

#--------------------------------------------------
# Example 2 -- an integer vector object
y <- 1:100
y

# These provide slightly different information about numeric objects
class(y)
typeof(y)
mode(y)

# Vectors have length (number of elements) but not dimensions (reserved for 2-dimensional objects) or attributes (more complex objects)
length(y)
dim(y)
attributes(y)

#--------------------------------------------------
# Example 3 -- a numeric vector object
z <- as.numeric(y)
z

# These provide slightly different information about numeric objects
class(z)
typeof(z)
mode(z)

# Setting dimensions converts z to a matrix, which changes the output of the functions
dim(z) <- c(10,10)
z

# These provide slightly different information about numeric objects
class(z)
typeof(z)
mode(z)

# Now z is a more complex object, with dimensions and attributes
length(z)
dim(z)
attributes(z)

# Head and tail produce the requested number of elements (vectors) or rows (2-dimensional objects) from the beginning or end, respectively (6 rows by default)
head(z)
tail(z,3)

```


```{r}
typeof(z)
length(z)
class(z)
str(z) # stands for "structure" of an object
head(z) # returns the first 6 elements of an object
```

### Missing data and special values

R supports both missing data and special values in data structures. 

&nbsp;
#### Missing Data

Missing data is represented as `NA` (Not Available)
and can be used for all the vector types that we have covered, though the `NA` is displayed differently for factors:

```{r}
# numeric
y1 <- c(0.5, NA, 0.7)
y1

# integer
y2 <- c(1L, 2L, NA)
y2

# logical
y3 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA)
y3

# character
y4 <- c("a", NA, "c", "d", "e")
y4

# complex
y5 <- c(1+5i, 2-3i, NA)
y5

# factor
y6 <- factor(y4)
y6
```

&nbsp;

The function `is.na()` indicates which elements in a vector contain missing data by returning a logical vector with the same number of elements (`TRUE` for `NA`, `FALSE` for other values): 

```{r}
x <- c("a", NA, "c", "d", NA)
y <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
is.na(x)
is.na(y)
```

&nbsp;

The function `anyNA()` returns `TRUE` if the vector contains any missing values:

```{r}
anyNA(x)
anyNA(y)
```

&nbsp;

Many functions will not accept objects that contain `NA`s by default. Take `sum()` for example:

```{r}
z <- c(1,1,2,3,5,NA,13)
sum(z)
```

&nbsp;

The presence of any `NA` values in the input result in the function returning `NA`. If you get this result from a function, it is worth checking the help file (e.g. `?sum`). Often the functions will include an argument `na.rm` that can be used to exclude `NA` values from analysis. `sum()` has this argument, but it is set to `FALSE` by default:

```{r}
sum(z, na.rm = TRUE)
```

&nbsp;
#### Other Special Values

`Inf` is how R represents infinite values. You can have either positive or negative infinity.

```{r}
1/0
-1/0
10 * Inf
1/Inf
```

&nbsp;

`Inf` is generally treated as a real value however, and is not easily removed by arguments like `na.rm`:

```{r}
m <- c(1,2,Inf)
sum(m)
sum(m, na.rm=T)
```

&nbsp;

`NaN` means "Not a Number". It is an undefined value and used to represent the result of mathematical operations that are undefined. However, it can still be a placeholder in a numeric vector.

```{r}
0/0
2 * NaN
Inf * NaN
n <- c(1, 2, NaN)
typeof(n)
```

&nbsp;

The behavior of functions like `sum()` treat `NaN` values essentially the same way they treat `NA` values in most situations, and the `na.rm` will also filter out these values:

```{r}
sum(n)
sum(n, na.rm = TRUE)
```

&nbsp;

You will run into the occasional function that differentiates between `NA` and `NaN`, so be aware that they may produce different behavior under some circumstances.
