##  On Your Own

### Lists

**Lists** in R act as generalized containers. A **list** is a special type of vector, but unlike atomic vectors, the contents of a list are not restricted to a single mode and can encompass any mixture of data types. Lists are sometimes called "generic vectors"", because the elements of a list can be any type of R object, even lists containing further lists. This property makes them fundamentally different from atomic vectors.

Create **lists** using `list()`:

```{r}
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
x 
```

&nbsp;

A list does not print to the console like a vector. Instead, each element of the list starts on a new line. The reason is that *any* object can be placed as an element in a **list**, including larger objects like **data frames**. Placing each element on a sparate line allows room for these larger objects to be displayed.

Note that an empty **list** of the required length can also be created using `vector()`.

```{r}
x <- vector("list", length = 5) # empty list
x 
length(x)
```

&nbsp;

Coerce other objects (like **vectors**) to **lists** using `as.list()`:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x <- as.list(x)
class(x)
length(x)
```

&nbsp;
#### Indexing lists

Indexing works a bit differently for lists. The content of elements of a list can be retrieved by using double square brackets `[[n]]`, as opposed to the single square brackets `[n]` used for vectors and matrices.

```{r}
x[[1]]
```

&nbsp;

Single `[]` indexing still works, but returns a list with the indexed elements. Double `[[]]` indexing returns the object inside the requested element itself. With that in mind, consider the following exercise:

> ## Examining Lists
>
> 1. What is the class of `x[1]`?
> 2. What is the class of `x[[1]]`?
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. 
> >     ```{r examine-lists-1}
> >     class(x[1])
> >     ```
> > 2. 
> >     ```{r examine-lists-2}
> >     class(x[[1]])
> >     ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

&nbsp;

Another consequence of the difference between `[]` and `[[]]` indexing is that you cannot request that R return more than one element from a list using `[[]]`:

```{r}
x[[c(1,2)]]
```
&nbsp; 

Because the `[[]]` index returns the object *inside* the requested **list** element, entering a range of indexes actually requests that R return multiple separate objects, possibly with different classes. If you want to return a **list** that is a subset of the current **list**, use `[]`:

```{r}
y <- x[c(1,2)]
y
class(y)
```

&nbsp; 

Elements of a list can be named (i.e. lists can have the `names` attribute)

```{r}
xlist <- list(a = "Karthik Ram", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist
names(xlist)
attributes(xlist)
```

&nbsp;

You can use the `$` operator to directly refer to  **list** elements using their name. These are equivalent requests:

```{r}
xlist[[1]]
xlist$a
```

> ## Examining Named Lists
>
> 1. What is the length of the `xlist` object?
> 2. What is its structure?
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. 
> >     ```{r examine-named-lists-1}
> >     length(xlist)
> >     ```
> > 2. 
> >     ```{r examine-named-lists-2}
> >     str(xlist)
> >     ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge} 

&nbsp;
#### Lists of lists!

A list can even have vectors (or other lists!) as one element of a list:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- c(T, F, T, T) # "T" can be used in place of "TRUE"; "F" can be used in place of "FALSE"
z <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)

my.list <- list(x, y, z)
my.list

my.list[[1]]
class(my.list[[1]])
class(my.list[[2]])

my.list <- list(x = x, y = y, z = x) # use the `=` to name your list elements
my.list$x
```

&nbsp;
#### Lists and functions

**Lists** can be extremely useful when used in *functions*. One property of functions in R is that they are able to return only a single object. To get around this restriction, you can "staple" together lots of different types of information into a single **list** object that a function can return.

A basic example is the function `t.test()`, which performs a Student's t test between two data samples (more on this in coming lessons). For now, let's run a basic t-test between petal length and width in the `iris` data set in order to examine the structure of the output.

```{r}
l.vs.w <- t.test(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width)
l.vs.w
```

&nbsp;

The t-test output returns more than just a p-value; it returns a complex set of information about the parameters and statistics of the performed test, for instance: 
* test alternatives: two-sided (**character**)
* specific type of t-test: Welch Two Sample t-test (**character**)
* the variables compared: "iris$Petal.Length and iris$Petal.Width" (**character**)
* t statistic value (**numeric**)
* number of degrees of freedom (df; **numeric**)
* confidence interval (**numeric vector**)

R can return all of this information in a single output because each value is contained as a separate element of a **list**:

```{r}
typeof(l.vs.w)
str(l.vs.w)
```

&nbsp;

Because this data is formatted as a list, we can extract specific components for further use (e.g. to print onto a chart, or use to separate signficant comparisons from a computed set of t-tests) using either `[[]]` or `$`. Let's pull the p-value for instance:

```{r}
l.vs.w$p.value
l.vs.w[[3]]
```

***
### Data frames are specialized lists

At its heart, the **data frame** is a special type of **list** in which every element is a **vector** with the same length as every other element. In other words, a data frame is a "rectangular" or "two-dimensional" list. 

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(id = letters[1:10], x = 1:10, y = 11:20)
dat
```

&nbsp;

we can see that R considers a **data frame** a **list** using the `is.list()` function, and by examining the underlying data type:

```{r}
is.list(dat)
is.data.frame(dat) # "data.frame" is a sub-class of "list"
class(dat)
typeof(dat)
```

&nbsp;

The formal definition of a **data frame** as a list is why we can use `[[]]` and `$` to rapidly interact with data in a data frame. 

```{r}
dat$id
dat[[2]]
```

&nbsp;

While the restriction that all elements (aka columns) must have the same length allows us to treat **data frames** as two-dimensional structures and use the `[x,y]` indexing format similar to matricies:

```{r}
dat[3,2]
dat[2:8,2:3]
```

*** 
### Advanced indexing

During the *In Class* component of this lesson, we examined the three primary modes of indexing *data frames* and other R objects:
* By index
* By name
* By logical vector

Here we will expand on these basic concepts to demonstrate different way to extract useful information from datasets represented in *data frame objects*. 

&nbsp;
#### Logical indexing -- additional detail

We noted *In Class* that logical indexing is one of the more powerful ways to index data. There are many operators that expand our logical toolbox.

**Relational operators**

The most common application of logical indexing is to use the information contained within one or more variables (i.e. columns) of a **data frame** to extract a subset of data that has a desired set of relational properties. To do so, we first need to generate a logical vector based on the information in the variable(s) of interest, which we will then use to index the **data frame**.

Logical vectors can be created using `relational operators`:
* `<` = less than
* `>` = greater than
* `<=` = less than or equal to
* `>=` = greater than or equal to
* `==` = exactly equal to
* `!=` = not equal to
* `%in%` = is present in (used to ask if the value(s) on the left is present in the vector/matrix on the right)

A few single variable examples:
```{r logical_variable_example}
1 == 1
1 == 2
1 != 1
4 > 7
18 %in% 1:10
18 %in% 15:25
```

&nbsp;

We can use these operators to query entire vectors and generate logical vectors:

```{r logical_vector_example}
# creating logical vectors from numeric data
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13)
x < 10
x %in% 1:10
```

&nbsp;

Each comparison generates a **logical vector** as output with the same number of elements as the vector on the left side of the relational operator, evaluating each input element relative to the right side of the operator. We can use logical vectors to select data from a **data frame**.

```{r logical_vectors_indexing}
index <- iris$Species == 'setosa'
index
iris[index,]
```

&nbsp;

Often this operation is written as one line of code:

```{r logical_vectors_indexing2}
iris[iris$Species == 'setosa', ]
```

> equal to 5.0.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > ```{r}
> > iris.new <- iris[iris$Sepal.Length >= 5,]
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

&nbsp;

**Logical operators**

In addition to the numeric comparisons, there are a set of **logical operators** that compare **logical** variables and output a new **logical** variable:
* `!` = **NOT** (changes `TRUE` to `FALSE` and vice versa)
* `&` = element-wise **AND** (both are true; outputs vector for vector input comparing elements)
* `&&` = logical **AND** (both are true; only considers first element of a vector)
* `|` = element-wise **OR** (one or both are true; outputs vector for vector input comparing elements)
* `||` = logical **OR** (both are true; only considers first index of a vector)
* `xor(x,y)` = element-wise exclusive **OR** (either are true, but not both; outputs vector for vector input comparing elements)

```{r}
truth <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
lie <- !truth
truth
lie

T & T
T & F
T | F
F | F

c(T,F,F) & c(T,T,F)
c(T,F,F) && c(T,T,F)
```

&nbsp;

**Logical operators** allow us to combine multiple **relational operators** to extract subsets of data contained within a **data frame** with multiple selection criteria, for example the `iris` entries with extreme values for sepal length:

```{r}
extremes <- iris[(iris$Sepal.Length < 4.6) | (iris$Sepal.Length > 7.3), ]
extremes
```
&nbsp;

Note the use of parentheses `()` to break up each logical operation. These are not always absolutely necessary for the code to run properly, but are generally a good idea to use because they always assist you (the coder) to explicitly breakup the order of operations with complex statements.

&nbsp; 
#### Combined indexing

One way to leverage indexing is to combine different indexing categories. For instance, column names can be combined with direct indexing to return a **data frame** subset only containing specific columns:

```{r}
length.only <- iris[,c("Petal.Length", "Sepal.Length", "Species")]
head(length.only)
```

&nbsp;

On occasion, it is useful to convert a **logical vector** into a set of numbered indexes, which we can accomplish using the `which()` function:

```{r}
x <- c(T, T, F, F, T, F)
which(x)
```

&nbsp;

This simple example illustrates that `which()` returns a vector containing the numbered index of each `TRUE` in the vector `x`. We can apply this to our `iris` dataset:

```{r}
index <- which(iris$Sepal.Length > 5.0)
index
```

&nbsp;

We now have a list of the index positions of rows in the `iris` **data frame** for the flowers with the largest sepal lengths. We can now use this information to, say, extract all information about these flowers:

```{r}
long.sepal <- iris[index,]
head(long.sepal)
```

&nbsp;

Or just information on a specific variable:

```{r}
iris$Sepal.Width[index]
```

&nbsp;

Using `which()` in this way is an efficient way to store information on a relevant data subset that you will be interacting with more than once, without creating a whole separate **data frame**.

&nbsp;
#### Updating subsets

We can use the assignement operator `<-` to directly update a subset of a **vector** or **data frame**. 

```{r}
x <- 1:20
x
x[x > 15] <- 100
x
```

&nbsp; 

Say you discover that the values collected for the petal length of the `setosa` species of `iris` were incorrectly recorded, and you want to replace these values with `NA` to ensure that they are not used in future work.

```{r}
# copy the data frame (never modify your raw data!)
iris.corrected <- iris
iris.corrected$Petal.Length[iris.corrected$Species == "setosa"] <- NA
iris.corrected
```
