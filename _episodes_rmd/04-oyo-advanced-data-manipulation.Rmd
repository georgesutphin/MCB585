## On Your Own

### Advanced Data Manipulation

*In Class* we covered a few of the basic functions for calculating descriptive statistics. Here we will examine a few techniques for using these functions more efficiently across data sets.

&nbsp;
#### The `apply()` function

To start, let's reload the aneurisms dataset that we were using *In Class*, and specifically the version with the gender capitalization corrected:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv(file="data/sample-gendercorrected.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

&nbsp;

In this dataset, we have aneurism counts in patient eyes at four time points. What if our phenotype of interest is the maximum number of aneurisms across quarters for each patient, or perhaps the average across quarters? How do we calculate these values efficiently for each patient. We want to perform the repeat the same operation across a `margin` of the data frame (in this case a each row, but it can similarly apply to columns):

<img src="../fig/r-operations-across-margins.svg" alt="Operations Across Margins" />

&nbsp;

In particular, we want to perform the functions `max()` or `mean()` on the last 4 columns of every row. To support this, we can use the `apply()` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?apply
```

&nbsp;

`apply()` allows us to repeat a function on each of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) or columns (`MARGIN = 2`) of a data frame. To obtain the maximum or average inflammation of each patient we will need to calculate the `max` or `mean` of all of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) of the relevant subset of the `dat` data frame. Let's start with mean:

```{r}
avg_aneurisms_subject <- apply(dat[,6:9], 1, mean)
avg_aneurisms_subject
```

&nbsp;

Each element in the `avg_aneurisms_subject` vector is the mean of the four values in the `Aneurisms_q1`, `Aneurisms_q2`, `Aneurisms_q3`, and `Aneurisms_q4` columns for the corresponding row in the `dat` data frame. Note that the length of this vector is the same as the number of rows in the `dat` data frame:

```{r}
length(avg_aneurisms_subject)
dim(dat)[1]
```

&nbsp;
 
A convenient way to associated this data with the corresponding patient is to directly add the calculated data to the data frame in a new column instead of assigning it to a separate vector:

```{r}
dat$Aneurisms_avg <- apply(dat[,6:9], 1, mean)
```

&nbsp;

By changing to `MARGIN = 2` (calculate across columns), we ask a different question, namely what is the average number of aneurisms across patients for each quarter:

```{r}
avg_aneurisms_quarter <- apply(dat[,6:9], 2, mean)
avg_aneurisms_quarter
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

> ## Argument Order in Functions
>
> Notice that we did not specify the argument names in `apply()`. Looking at the help file, the argument
> order is `X` (indicating the input data), then `MARGIN`, then `FUN` (for function to apply). So long as you
> enter arguments in the requested order, you do not need to be explicitly about which argument you are

> For example, this will return an error:
> ```{r eval=F}
> avg_aneurisms_subject <- apply(mean, 1, dat[,6:9])
> ```
>
> while this will be interpreted identically to the earlier function call:
> ```{r eval=F}
> avg_aneurisms_subject <- apply(FUN = mean, MARGIN = 1, X = dat[,6:9])
> ```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

> Some common operations have more efficient alternatives. For example, you
> can calculate the row-wise or column-wise means with `rowMeans()` and
> `colMeans()`, respectively. Similarly for `rowSums()` and `colSums()`.

&nbsp;
#### Aggregating data

Looking at summary statistics of the entire data set is great, but usually we are more interested in comparing these statistics across groups. R has a function called `aggregate()` that lets you apply a function (or more than one function) to a dependent variable (or more than one dependent variable) with the data separated by one or more independent variables.

```{r eval=F}
?aggregate
```

&nbsp;

As with the `boxplot()` function, `aggregate()` uses formula notation. To get a feel for how the function operates, let's calculate the `mean()` of our newly calculated average aneurisms variable, broken down by treatment group. `aggregate()` requires three arguments: (1) the formula that defines how the data should be broken down, (2) the data to be used, and (3) the function that you would like to perform:

```{r}
mean_by_group <- aggregate(Aneurisms_avg ~ Group, data = dat, FUN = mean)
mean_by_group
```

&nbsp;

Great! `aggregate()` selected the subset of `Aneurisms_avg` values for each treatment group and returned the mean. What if we also want to see the breakdown by Gender?

```{r}
mean_by_group_gender <- aggregate(Aneurisms_avg ~ Group + Gender, data = dat, FUN = mean)
mean_by_group_gender
```

&nbsp;

So far so good. Now, what if we wean to calculate more than just the mean? Maybe standard deviation to examin variability as well? This makes things a bit more complicated, but `aggregate()` is up to the task. First, `aggregate()` can technically only take one "input" function. However, we can get around this by defining our own input `function()` on the fly that includes multiple sub-functions combined using the `c()` function:

```{r}
avg_aneurisms_summary <- aggregate(Aneurisms_avg ~ Group + Gender, data = dat, 
    FUN = function(x) c(mean(x), sd(x))) 
avg_aneurisms_summary
```

&nbsp;

Now, this new object `avg_aneurisms_summary` looks like a standard **data frame** on the surface, and even claims to be one:

```{r}
class(avg_aneurisms_summary)
```

&nbsp;

However, if you actually look at the structure there is something odd going on:

```{r}
str(avg_aneurisms_summary)
```

&nbsp;

Instead of creating separate columns for the calculated `mean()` and `sd()` values, `aggregate()` made those values columns of a **numeric matrix** and assigned that **matrix** to a single "column" of the data frame:

```{r}
# This doesn't actually contain any information:
avg_aneurisms_summary$Aneurisms_avg.1

# While this contaims a matrix (rather than a vector)
avg_aneurisms_summary$Aneurisms_avg
```

&nbsp;

To fix this odd formating, we can use the function `do.call()` to convert the "matrix-within-a-data-frame" into a normal data frame, and then fix the column names to make them meaningful. We can actually just do this all in one step from the beginning:

```{r}
# first run the aggregate function with do.call
avg_aneurisms_summary <- do.call(data.frame, 
                     aggregate(Aneurisms_avg ~ Group + Gender, data = dat,                      FUN = function(x) c(mean(x), sd(x)))) 

# check the baseline names of the output (not helpful!)
names(avg_aneurisms_summary)

# correct the names of the newly created variables to reflect the functions that 
# were used to generate them
names(avg_aneurisms_summary)[c(3,4)] <- c("Aneurisms_avg_mean", "Aneurisms_avg_sd")

# Now check out the structure. This looks more like what we might have first expected
avg_aneurisms_summary
str(avg_aneurisms_summary)
```

&nbsp;

Finally, we will often want to apply the same set of functions to multiple dependent variables. To tie this all together, let's calculate the same `mean()` and `sd()` for both `Aneurisms_avg` and `Aneurisms_total`. Do do this, we need to add an additional dependent variable to our `formula` notation, and bind them together using the `cbind()` function:

```{r}
# First calculate the statistics using aggregate() and convert the output to a
# standard data frame using do.call()
aneurisms_summary <- do.call(data.frame, 
                             aggregate(cbind(Aneurisms_avg, Aneurisms_total) ~ Group + Gender, 
                                       data = dat, 
                                       FUN = function(x) c(mean(x), sd(x)))) 

# don't forget to correct the column names to something more meaningfule 
names(aneurisms_summary)[3:6] <- c("Aneurisms_avg_mean", "Aneurisms_avg_sd",
                                          "Aneurisms_total_mean", "Aneurisms_total_sd")

# ... and take a look at the results
aneurisms_summary
```

&nbsp;

Using the `aggregate()` function to it's full potential is, admittedly, a bit convoluted. If you don't quite get all of the detail, especially how to format and deal with the output of a multiple-dependent-variable, multiple-independent-variable, multiple-function `aggregate()` call, that's okay. The goal here is to demonstrate that what is possible with the basic functions available in R. Even the basic single-function `aggregate()` can be really useful in speeding up data processing. Start there and work you way up.

> To do this you would extract the relevant subset from the data frame and calculate the maximum value.
> Which of the following lines of R code gives the correct answer?
>

>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > Answer: 3
> >
> > Explanation: You want to extract the part of the data frame representing data for patient 5 from quarter two (column 7) to quarter 4 (column 9). In this data frame, patient data is organised in rows and the days are represented by the columns. Subscripting in R follows the `[i, j]` principle, where `i = rows` and `j = columns`. Thus, answer 3 is correct since the patient is represented by the value for i (5) and the days are represented by the values in j, which is a subset spanning day 9 to 7.

### Plotting -- Additional Detail

R is a robust platform for creating publication quality graphics, regardless of the complexity of you data and presentation. We really just scratched the surface *In Class* and there is no way we will be able to adequately cover the available tools in one session of one class. The goal is to give you a taste of what you can do (i.e. virtually anything you can image) and where to look for the tools to begin to do so.

&nbsp;
#### Multipanel plots

Most figures contain multiple panels containing different information. One option is to generate each panel as a separate figure and stitch them together after the fact using a PDF editor or some other graphics program. However, R has the tools to build multipanel plots. Let's look at how we can put multiple related panels in the same plot. This requires going beyond the `plot()` and `boxplot()` functions.

Take a look at the `?plot` documentation. Notice that there really aren't that many input options, but that there is a "..." listed, which references the `par()` function. This will also introduce you to the `par()` function. Under the surface, there are  hundreds of tweaks that you can make to plots through arguments. R has a set of predefined graphical parameters that are all stored in the background. The `par()` function queries and sets these parameters. If you don't give it any arguments, `par()` will return the current settings for all of these variables. We can see what settings are available and what the defaults are using `?par`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?par
```

&nbsp;

Before you start to fiddle with `par()`, it is a good idea to store all of the current settings to a variable, which can be used to restore the default if we need to later on.

```{r}
plot.options <- par()
```

&nbsp;

Now to take a look at what we have:

```{r}
head(plot.options) # this is a list with a bunch of graphical related variables
length(plot.options) # there are 72 variables that we can tweak in par() alone, and some have multiple parameters
```

&nbsp;

Consider the `iris` data set. If we want to make a multipanel plot, say with box plots of Petal Length and Petal Width, and then the correlation between them, we can use `par()` before running plot to tell R how many rows and columns of figure panels  we want to create. We use this by passing the argument `mfrow = c(<# of rows>, <# of columns>)` to `par()`. This changes the value of the background graphical parameters. Note that we later have to change this back if we want to make a single-panel plot.

Once we set `mfrow` we can then run our previous plot commands in the order we want them displayed. Let's give it a try:

```{r}
# get the current graphical parameters
old.plot.options <- par() # it never hurts to save a copy of the old parameters, so we can reset them if we break something

# setup a plot with 3 figure panels in a row using the mfrow argument
par(mfrow = c(1,3)) # 1 row, 3 columns

# Panel 1: Box plot with jittered stripchart points for Petal Length
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
        outline = FALSE, ylab = "Petal Length (cm)")
stripchart(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
           pch = 16, method = "jitter",
           add=TRUE, vert=TRUE)

# Panel 2: Box plot with jittered stripchart points for Petal Width
boxplot(Petal.Width ~ Species, data = iris,
        outline = FALSE, ylab = "Petal Width (cm)")
stripchart(Petal.Width ~ Species, data = iris,
           pch = 16, method = "jitter",
           add=TRUE, vert=TRUE)

# Panel 3: Scatter plot comparing Petal Length to Petal Width
col.list <- c("red", "blue", "green")
col.vector <- col.list[iris$Species]
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width,
     xlab = "Petal Length (cm)", ylab = "Petal Width (cm)",
     col = col.vector)
legend("bottomright", legend = levels(iris$Species), col=col.list, pch=1)

# and finally, reset the mfrow argument to a single panel
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

&nbsp;
#### Box plots with multiple independent variables -- getting to publication quality

Box plots begin to tax the default behavior of R when it comes to things like axis labeling. Let's use the gender-corrected and processed version of our aneurism data ("sample-processed.csv") to take a look at plotting when multiple independent variables are in play. First, load the data:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/sample-processed.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
head(dat)
```

&nbsp;

What if we want to plot total aneurisms broken down by both gender and treatment group. The `formula` notation used in `boxplot()` makes this pretty straightforward:

```{r}
# use the '+' to indicate multiple grouping variables
boxplot(Aneurisms_total ~ Group + Gender, data = dat)
```

&nbsp;

We have the data in the right place, but the group labels are all horizontal, so they can't be displayed. There is also no clear visual way to distinguish how the treatment groups and gender groups are separated.

We can take several steps to improve the look in chart:
* Use the `at` argument to change the box spacing. By default, boxes are drawn centered over the integers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, where n is the number of boxes. By redefining these locations and skipping numbers, you can add spaces between groups.
* Use box colors to indicate treatment groups (`col` argument plus the `legend()` function) and x-axis labels to indicate gender. There are other ways to do this, but this is one of the more visually appealing.
* Tick marks are often not useful in box plots. To turn them off, we will use the `xaxt` to run off all x-axis feature, and then use the separate function `axis()` to add the ones we want back (sans tick marks).
* Make the y-axis label look better with `ylab`.
* Add all points with `stripchart()`.

```{r}
# draw the box plot first
boxplot(Aneurisms_total ~ Group + Gender, data = dat,
        xaxt = "n", xlab = "", # turn off all x-axis labeling (so we can redraw it below)
        ylab = "# Aneurisms", # y axis label
        at = c(1,2,3, 5,6,7), # leave a space between gender groups
        col = c("grey","blue","red")) # color boxes by treatment for legend

# now add the points with stripchart with the same parameters as box
stripchart(Aneurisms_total ~ Group + Gender, data = dat,
        add = TRUE, vert = TRUE, # add the points to the current boxplot vertically
        at = c(1,2,3, 5,6,7), # leave a space between gender groups
        col = c("black"), pch = 16, # color and symbol for points
        method = "jitter") # jitter the points

# next add gender labels to the x-axis
axis(side = 1, # add axis labels to the x-axis
     at = c(2,6), # place the labels under the middle boxes of each group
     labels = c("female","male"), # gender labels
     tick = FALSE) # do not add tick marks

# now add a legend to indicate
legend(x = "top", inset = -0.13, # place the legend on top, but nudge it up a bit
       xpd = T, # allow the legend to be drawn outside the plot area
       bty = "n", # don't draw a box around the legend
       ncol = 3, # use 3 columns (one row, since we have 3 groups)
       fill = c("grey", "blue", "red"), # fill boxes with the same colors as boxplot
       legend = levels(dat$Group)) # labels by treatment group
```

&nbsp;

This ends up with a fairly complex script for a single chart, but when you start to directly generate publication quality graphics in R, this is what it tends to look like. Once you go through the process of setting up a plot that you like once, you can always copy that whole chunk of code into the next project (or write a custom plot function with your own defaults!). Over time, you build up a sort of personal "library" of code chunks and can make really nice graphics in relatively little time.

&nbsp;
#### Other resources for plotting

This lesson gives you access to the two most common chart types used in biology: scatterplots and box plots (which can usually be used in place of bar charts). This is just the tip of a very large iceberg. R has the capability of producing any visualization you can imagine, and there are full workshops and courses dedicated just to generating graphics in R. The potential applications are as varied as your projects, and the best thing you can do is to sit down and start using the functions with Google search close at hand.

We don't have the time to do everything, but we will be using both of these chart types throughout the course, and introducing several others (histograms, density charts, line graphs, Kaplan-Meier charts, etc).  For now, a few resources that will help you along the way:
* A cheat sheet for the graphics tools that come with R (aka "R base graphics") can be downloaded [here]({{ page.root }}/fig/BaseGraphicsCheatsheet.pdf).
* The `lattice` package makes some improvements to R base graphics and functions. The defaults are better for example.
* The other commonly graphics package is called `ggplot2`. I have tended toward base graphics, because you can literally do anything with them, but `ggplot2` is easier in some ways, once you get the syntax down (which is very different). Cheat sheet is [here]({{ page.root }}/fig/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf).
* Google is your friend. There are probably thousands of tutorials, forum Q&As, cheat sheets, etc. to answer your project specific questions. For a taste, go to Google and search "publication quality graphics in R"

> ## Exploring plot options
>
> R has hundreds of ways to change the way plots are displayed. The only way to
> really learn how to manipulate charts is to start playing with the options to
> see what they do. Below are a range of options that I have used at one point
> or another.
>
> Try starting with one of the plots with today's lesson, change one
> or more of the following parameters, then rerun the plot script to see what
> changed. A good way to do this is to plot two charts with a single argument change
> to the RStudio plot panel. The arrows at the top left of the panel let you look
> through previous charts and see what changed. Alternatively, write the two charts
> to subsequent pages of a PDF file for comparison.
>
> **Arguments to the `plot()` function**
> *Remember that default values can be found in `?plot` or by running `par()` with no arguments, and argument descriptions can be accessed in `?par`.*
> * *bty*
> * *border*
> * *col*
> * *lty*
> * *lwd*
> * *main*
> * *sub*
> * *type*
> * *xlab*, *ylab*
> * *xlim*, *ylim*
> * *xaxs*, *yaxs*
> * *xaxt*, *yaxt*
> * *xlog*, *ylog*
> * *xpd*
>
> **Arguments to the `par()` function**
> *Note that these are typically passed to `par()` prior to running running a plot
> function. Run `par()` for defaults and `?par` for argument descriptions.
> * *cex*
> * *mar*

> *You can set most of the arguments listed above in `plot()` using the `par()`
> function as well, and it will set the default for future charts.*
>
> **Functions that add elements to existing plots**
> *For this set, first generate a plot (e.g. with `plot()` or `boxplot()`)
> and then call the following functions. Use `?` to see what arguments are
> required for each*
> * `abline()`
> * `axis()`
> * `box()`
> * `legend()`
