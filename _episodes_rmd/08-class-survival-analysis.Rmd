## In Class

So far we have mostly been dealing with data that meets that basic assumptions of a t-test or other common statistical tests. In this class, we are going to look at a category of data that requires special consideration. Time-to-event data (e.g. survival or lifespan data) violates several assumptions made by many of our standard tests:

* It is not generally normally distributed.
* Observations are not independent (more below on this).
* Data is often censored.

In the following sections we will examine common methods for formatting, displaying, and analyzing time-to-event data, and how to implement these methods in R.

***
#### Missing data and censoring

When you are dealing with time-to-event data, subjects are selected (aka sampled) and observed repeatedly until some event occurs (or does not occur). This opens the possibility that a study will be completed without an observation of the event under study actually occurring. This can happen for a few reasons:

* A subject is removed from the study (e.g. a patient in a drug trial stops taking the drug on their own)
* A related event occurs that precludes occurrence of the event of interest (e.g. a patient in a cancer drug trial is killed in a car accident; this prevents the event of interest, "death from cancer" from occurring)
* A subject remains in the study, but the study concludes before the event of interest occurs

To deal with these cases, we include the subject in the study but use censoring to indicate that the event of interest was not observed between specific defined time points. There are three types of censoring:

1. Right-censoring: the event of interest occurs after some time *t*, but the specific time of is unknown.
 + e.g. a subject dies of an unrelated cause 
 + e.g. a subject is still alive at the end of the study
 + e.g. a subject leaves the study prior to its conclusion
 
2. Left-censoring: an individual’s entry date is unknown (e.g. birthdate in lifespan studies).
 + e.g. a subject infected with a pathogen enters a study, but the infection date is unknown 
 
3. Interval-censoring: the event of interest occurred in a known interval, but the precise time is unknown.
 + e.g. a patient is diagnosed with the disease of interest during a follow-up visit after a study concludes

Right-censoring is the most common. This is particularly true when using a model organism in the lab, where the birthdate or other entry criteria can be tightly controlled, but an individual exiting a study can happen for various reasons. We will only examine right-censoring in this class, but be aware of the other forms, particularly if you are dealing with data collected from human subjects.

### Survival curves

The most common form of data presented for time-to-event data is the survival curve. The curve shows the fraction or percentage of the population surviving at a given time. The time measure can be age (as is the case for lifespan) or some other relevant defined point (e.g. diagnosis with a disease, cancer remission, time of treatment). 

<img src="../fig/generic-survival-curve.png" alt="Survival Curve" />

Of course, we generally don't know the survival for every individual in the population and need to draw a best estimate from our sample data. To deal with this issue, we use two tools called the *Life Table*, to generate information about the survival characteristics over time, and *Kaplan-Meier curves* to draw approximate survival curves from sample data.

&nbsp;
#### The life table

The *Life Table* is a systematic way to tabulate observations and estimate survival parameters based on sample data. A Life Table has the following basic information:

<img src="../fig/life-table-partial.png" alt="Partial Life Table" />

* $$t_0 =$$ start time, relative to the time period of interest (e.g. for lifespan data, each individual's birth is set to time 0, even if they were born on different dates) 
* $$t =$$ observation time 
* $$d_t =$$ number of events observed at time t
* $$n_0 = \sum d_t =$$ original sample size (number of individuals in the sample prior to censoring or events)
* $$n_t = n_0 - \sum_{x = 0}^{t-1} d_x =$$ number of individuals at risk at time t (e.g. sampled, uncensored individuals with no event by time t)
* $$l_t = \frac{n_t}{n_0} =$$ fraction of the sample remaining at risk by time t
* $$S(t) \approx l_t =$$ survival function, the fraction of the population at risk at (aka "surviving to") time t 

We estimate the survival function by plotting $$l_t$$ vs. age $$t$$. Let's examine the survival of the US population as an example. The life table is stored in `US2011.life.table.txt`.

```{r}
lt <- read.delim("./data/US2011.life.table.txt")
str(lt)
```

&nbsp; 

Note that what I called $$n_t$$ this particular data set calls $$l_x$$ (and that all subscripts are "x" instead of "t"). Some of the above variables (e.g. our $$l_t$$) are missing. To start, let's rename the variables to match our convention and calculate $$l_t$$:

```{r}
# rename life table variables
names(lt) <- c("t","qt","nt","dt","Lt","Tt","et")

# calculate l{t}
lt$lt <- lt$nt/max(lt$nt)
head(lt)
```

&nbsp; 

Now we can plot the survival curve:

```{r}
plot(lt$t,lt$lt, type = "l",
     main="US Survival 2011",
     xlab="Age (years)",ylab="Fraction Surviving")
```

&nbsp; 

Great! That looks like a standard survival curve to me. We can see that median lifespan is around 85 years and maximum is out around 100. The tip of the tail (which won't appear on this chart since we only has ~100,000 people out of ~300,000,000) is really out at 122 or so.

From the equation for $$l_t$$, we can see that it depends on $$n_t$$, which in turn depends on all of the previously observed events ($$d_0$$ to $$d_t-1$$). Thus the survival function cannot be considered an variable with independent observations. This is one reason we can't use a t-test to make comparisons. For that we need to look at a different aspect of time-to-event data. A complete life table will have a few more columns:

<img src="../fig/life-table-full.png" alt="Full Life Table" />

* $$p_t = l_{t+1}/l_t =$$ probability that someone with no event at time t will still have no event by time t + 1.
* $$q_t = 1 - p_t =$$ probability that someone with no event at time t will experience the event by time t + 1.
* $$\lambda(t) = -\frac{\delta}{dx} ln[S(x)] \approx -ln(p_t) =$$ instantaneous rate at which the event occurs at time t; the slope of the log of the survival function. For survival data specifically, this is also called $$\mu_x =$$ age-specific mortality. 

The last variable, $$\lambda(t)$$ is called the hazard function (aka hazard rate, $$h(x)$$), or in the context of survival data, age-specific mortality or force of mortality ($$\mu_x$$). Conceptually, age-specific mortality represents the chance of an individual dying at that specific age. 

$$\lambda(t)$$, while not normally distributed, does not depend on previous observations, and can thus be considered a variable for which observations are independent. This allows us to make statistical comparisons. Let's look at how $$\lambda(t)$$ behaves.

```{r}
# calculate pt and lambdat
lt$pt <- 1 - lt$qt
lt$lambdat <- -log(lt$pt)

# plot age specific mortality -- does the shape look familiar?
plot(lt$t, lt$lambdat, type = "l",
     main="US Age-Specific Mortality 2011",
     xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Age-Specific Mortality")
```

&nbsp;

Does that shape look familiar? It appears to increase exponentially with age. Try plotting the y-axis on a log-scale (using the `log = "y"` argument in plot; alternatively, you could plot `log(lt$lambdat)` on the y-axis):

```{r}
plot(lt$t, lt$lambdat, type = "l", log="y",
     main="US Age-Specific Mortality 2011",
     xlab="Age (years)",
     ylab="Age-Specific Mortality")
```

&nbsp;

Despite the some odd behavior during the early part of life, age-specific mortality appears to increase linearly during the majority of adulthood. That looks like something we can model!

&nbsp;
#### Kaplan-Meier curves

We never actually know the "real" shape of the survival curve for our population, or even our sample, because of the structure of time-to-event data. This is true for two reasons:

* We often have missing data that requires censoring (i.e. the event was never observed)
* Subjects are only observed at discrete time points, so we don't have access to the exact time that the event occurred. We instead know that the event had not occurred at some time *t - 1*, but that the event had occurred by time *t*. 

There is a type of survival curve estimator called the Kaplan-Meier curve which allows us to approximate the shape of the survival curve for a given set of time-to-event observations. Kaplan-Meier curves have the following properties.

* Estimates true survival curve when data is missing (i.e. when one or more observations is censored)
* Assumes that no deaths occur between observation times (i.e. approximates that each event occurred at the observation time, rather than at some unknown time between observations)
* Tick marks are used to indicate time at which a subject was censored for missing data.
* For the purposes of drawing the curve, censored individuals are included in the "total" or "at risk" sample size up until the time point where they were censored. After that point, the change in curve height for a new event occurrence is dependent on the reduced sample size with out the censored individual.

This is because the pool of patients remaining "at risk" for the event drops when either an event is experienced or when a patient is censored.

<img src="../fig/kaplan-meier-curve.jpg" alt="Kaplan-Meier Curve" />

When an event occurs, the curve drops by a fraction of the remaining "at risk" pool *at that time point*. As patients are censored without an observed event, the remaining "at risk" pool decreases. Thus subsequent events drop the remaining % remaining by a larger and larger margin. A good step-by-step guide to how Kaplan-Meier curves are drawn can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/kaplan-meier-curves-c5768e349479).

Let's look at our data from the inbred mouse aging study for an example. Make sure that the `survival` package is loaded, and read in the mouse lifespan data. For our purposes, let's look specifically at the strain BUB/BnJ, which has a number of censored mice.

```{r}
# load survival package
library("survival")

# read in inbred strain lifespan data
data.surv <- read.delim("data/inbred.lifespan.txt")

# grab the subset of data for BUB/BnJ 
surv.bub <- data.surv[data.surv$strain == "BUB/BnJ",]

# check out the data
str(surv.bub)
```

&nbsp;

For survival analysis, the survival packages uses an odd notation for simulating the survival curve. In order to include data censoring, instead of using `lifespan_days` directly as the dependent variable, we use the notation `Surv(time, event status)`. This tells R that we have a set of censored survival data with observed event times (`lifespan_days`), and some mice that were censored and not observed to have died (`censor`). Let's contrast the data format here to the life table that we looked at above:

* **Life tables** describe populations, providing information about the number or fraction of individuals in different categories, or other population-level information like age-specific mortality for individuals within that population.
* **Mortality** data like that provided in the inbred mouse aging dataset describes individuals, providing phenotype data for each individual. 

A note on the lifespan variable. We have emphasized that the sampling method for survival data involves repeated binary observations (the event *did*/*did not* occur) at subsequent time points, but the mortality data simply provides a single data point for `lifespan_days`. The underlying assumption is that the individual was observed at all previous time points, but that the event of interest occurred at the reported time. If an individual was not censored (`censor = 0`), then we know the event occurred at that time point. If the individual was censored (`censor = 1`), then we know that the mouse was last observed alive at the reported time point. 

In our case, we use the `lifespan_days` as the time that we observed the event, and `censor` as our status variable. An important note: what `Surv()` wants for status is whether the event occurred. In this particular data set, the event was assumed to occur unless something odd happened (e.g. the mouse escaped), so `censor` is "0" when the mouse died (the event occurred) and "1" when something else happened (e.g. the mouse was "censored" and removed from the study because death, the event, was never observed). Thus we need to tell R that `censor == 0` means "the event occurred". 

The `survfit()` function builds the life table that we need for our analyses. We embed the `Surv()` object as the dependent variable in side the `survfit()` function. `survfit()` *always* needs an independent variable. If you want to just plot all of the data as a single curve, you can just give it "1", which tells R not to subset the data before running the analysis:

```{r}
# calculate life table for BUB/BnJ mice
survfit.bub <- survfit(Surv(lifespan_days, censor == 0) ~ 1, data = surv.bub)

# use summary() to look at the life table
summary(survfit.bub)
```

&nbsp;

Now that we have the survival function, the `plot()` function already knows what we want to do with it: plot the Kaplan-Meier curve:

```{r}
# Plot the Kaplan-Meier curve
plot(survfit.bub, xlab = "Time (days)", 
     ylab="Fraction surviving", 
     conf.int=FALSE,              # turn of confidence intervals
     mark.time = TRUE,            # mark time of censor
     main="BUB/BnJ Survival")
```

&nbsp;

We can also break the data down into the two sexes. We do this using the dependent variable at the `survfit()` step:

```{r}
# calculate life table for BUB/BnJ mice with sex as an independent variable
survfit.bub.sex <- survfit(Surv(lifespan_days, censor == 0) ~ sex, data = surv.bub)

# use summary() to look at the life table
summary(survfit.bub.sex)
```

&nbsp;

Note that `survfit()` builds separate life tables for male and female mice. Now we can use `plot()` to generate the Kaplan-Meier curves for our new `survfit` object:

```{r}
# Plot the Kaplan-Meier curve
plot(survfit.bub.sex, xlab = "Time (days)", 
     ylab = "Fraction surviving", 
     col = c("red","blue"),
     conf.int=FALSE,              # turn of confidence intervals
     mark.time = TRUE,            # mark time of censor
     main = "BUB/BnJ Survival")

# add legend
legend("topright", lty = 1,
       col = c("red","blue"),
       legend = c("f","m"))
```

***
### The log-rank test 

Now that we can visualize our lifespan data, how do we conduct a hypothesis test to compare different groups? The most common test for lifespan data is the [log-rank test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test) (aka logrank or Mantel-Cox test). The log-rank test makes the assumption that the survival functions ($$S(t)$$) are the same for the two groups under the null hypothesis (essentially, this means that any censoring is correlated with survival). What the test does it:

1. Assume that the survival is equal and that any censoring does not impact the survival function.

2. At each observation point, calculate the difference in the number of observed events between comparison groups.

3. Sum the differences across time points to calculate the test statistics: $$z = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} (O_{1j} - O_{2j})}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{J} V_j}}$$

4. This test statistic is approximately normally distributed and can be used to calculate the probability that the observed difference represents a sample from the null distribution (or not) at a given $$\alpha$$.

In R, the `survdiff()` function performs a log-rank test using the same dependent and independent variable format as `survfit()`. Let's use it to see if there are differences in lifespan between male and female BUB/BnJ mice:

```{r}
logrank.bub <- survdiff(Surv(lifespan_days, censor == 0) ~ sex, data = surv.bub)
logrank.bub
```

&nbsp;

So there is no difference in lifespan between male and female BUB/BnJ mice. There is a quirk with the `survdiff()` function in R. How do you extract the P-value? Looking at the `survdiff` object, there doesn't seem to be a clear way to extract it directly:

```{r}
str(logrank.bub)
```

&nbsp;

Similar to how a t-test uses the t-distribution (which is a modified normal distribution) to calculate a P-value based on the area under a well-defined portion of the probability density curve, the log-rank test calculates a different statistics, called $$\chi$$, and uses another well-defined distribution, the $$\chi^2$$ distribution, to calculate P-values.  

For an obscure and mathematically dense reason, the creator of the `survdiff()` function decided not to directly report the P-value in the output of the function. However, he did include the calculated value of $$\chi^2$$, and R includes a function that defines the $$\chi^2$$ distribution, so we can relatively easily calculate it for ourselves.

```{r}
# extract the value of the chi-squared statistic from the survdiff object
# we also need the number of comparison groups, which defines the degrees 
# of freedom for the test (this is stored in the `n` variable)
chisq.bub <- logrank.bub$chisq
n.bub <- logrank.bub$n

# use the chisq statistic to calculate the P-value; the second argument
# is degrees of freedom (df), calculated from n. By default, and based on 
# the way the distribution is used in the function, qchisq() returns the 
# reciprocol of the P-value (1 - P). Setting `lower.tail = F` reverses 
# this and gives the P-value
P.bub <- pchisq(chisq.bub, length(n.bub) - 1, lower.tail = F)
P.bub
```

&nbsp;

Incidentally, we can similarly calculate the P-value from a `t` statistic (reported in the `t.test()` function) in place of `chisq` and the `pt()` function in place of the `pchisq()` function as above.
