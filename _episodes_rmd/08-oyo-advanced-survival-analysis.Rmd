##  On Your Own

Working with survival data in R is not straightforward and practice is useful for getting the hang of using the `Surv()` object and the functions for generating survival curves and running log-rank tests. For the most part, today's *On Your Own* material consists of additional exercise, with one practical note for dealing with an odd data structure.

***
### Extracting life table data from `survfit()`

*In Class* we looked at a life table for human mortality in the US. We were able to examine the age-specific $$\mu_x$$  (aka the hazard function $$\lambda(t)$$, which is one useful way to evaluate differences between groups in survival data. Because the log of age-specific mortality increases linearly with age, the intercept of this line can be interpreted as "initial mortality" in a population, and the slope as "rate of aging" (aka the rate at which the chance of dying at a given time increases with age). 

If we want to examine age-specific mortality for a survival dataset where the life table is not pre-built for us, R does not provide a straightforward solution. There is no function in R to directly plot $$\mu_x$$, so we have 
to extract the life tables and calculate it manually. Let's revisity the lifespan data for the BUB/BnJ mouse strain that we looked at *In Class*.

```{r}
# load the survival package
library("survival")

# read in inbred strain lifespan data and subset ou thet BUB/BnJ strain
data.surv <- read.delim("data/inbred.lifespan.txt")
surv.bub <- data.surv[data.surv$strain == "BUB/BnJ",]

# calculate life table for BUB/BnJ mice with sex as an independent variable
survfit.bub.sex <- survfit(Surv(lifespan_days, censor == 0) ~ sex, data=surv.bub)

# use summary() to capture the life table in a new variable
summary.bub <- summary(survfit.bub.sex)
summary.bub
```

&nbsp;

Let's take a closer look at the structure of the life tables stored in the `summary.bub` object:

```{r}
str(summary.bub)
```

&nbsp; 

This object has a variable called `strata` that defines the groups by which the comparison is broken down, and thus the defining feature for the two separate life tables stored within the object. You can use this to extract the separate life table columns for each sex from `summary.bub`. Here we will just extract the specific columns that we need to calculate $$\mu_x$$:

```{r}
# extract age, number of deaths, and number at risk at each age from the
# life tables stored in `summary.bub`. Note that the names assigned to the 
# "strata" are in the form "<variable>=<value>", so we use "sex=f" to extract
# the information for female mice
age.f <- summary.bub$time[summary.bub$strata == "sex=f"]
n.event.f <- summary.bub$n.event[summary.bub$strata == "sex=f"]
n.risk.f <- summary.bub$n.risk[summary.bub$strata == "sex=f"]

# calculate qt; note that this is an alternative way to get qx from using the 
# lx and lx+1 values. If you rearrange the life table equations you can derive 
# this form.
qx.f <- n.event.f/n.risk.f

# now calculate px and mux (mu is age-specific mortality)
px.f <- 1 - qx.f
mux.f <- -log(px.f)

# for the male mice ("sex=m"), I am just going to combine the above few steps
# into a single step.
age.m <- summary.bub$time[summary.bub$strata == "sex=m"]
mux.m <- -log(1 - summary.bub$n.event[summary.bub$strata == "sex=m"]/summary.bub$n.risk[summary.bub$strata == "sex=m"])

# Now we can finally plot. Someone should write a function to do this...
# Remember to put the y-axis on a log scale.
plot(age.f,mux.f, col = "red", log = "y", type="o", pch = 16, lwd = 1.7,  
     xlab = "Age", ylab = "Age-Specific Mortality",
     xlim = c(min(summary.bub$time),max(summary.bub$time)))
lines(age.m,mux.m, col = "blue", type="o", pch = 16, lwd = 1.7)
legend("bottomright",legend = c("female","male"), fill = c("red","blue"))
```

&nbsp;

Note that these plots can be somewhat sensitive to time periods during the lifespan where few mice died (particularly the early portion), creating odd jumps and jogs like the one present near the early male lifespan. Pay attention to the general trends (slope, intercept) to get a feel for how the groups differ. In this case, It looks like the male and female BUB/BnJ mice are pretty similar, showing a similar intercept and slope for the log-mortality curves.
