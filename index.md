Welcome to MCB 585! This course is offered by the Molecular & Cellular Biology Department at the University of Arizona. 

MCB585 is an advanced graduate course focused on quantitative approaches to biological questions. Students will learn how to acquire, access, and interact with large biological datasets. The first part of the course relies heavily on learning and utilizing the R Statistical Programming language, but students are not expected to have programming experience upon entering the course. The Fall 2025 course is broken up into two units. The first unit will focus on introducing R and using R in basic statistical operations. This section incorporates elements of experimental design and appropriate application of statistical tests as a frame for learning R. analyzing functional genomic and high-throughput data with an introduction to bioinformatics, machine learning, and data integration. 

**Instructors:**

*   **George Sutphin**, Assistant Professor, Molecular & Cellular Biology
*   **Guang Yao**, Associate Professor, Molecular & Cellular Biology

**Course Goals:**

Students will be able to:
1.	Use the R programming environment to approach basic problems in biological sciences.
2.	Apply basic biostatistics methods, such as selecting and employing an appropriate statistical test and conducting a power analysis based on preliminary data.
3.	Access, manipulate, and analyze large biological datasets.
4.	Perform RNA-sequencing analysis starting from raw reads all the way to differential expression and pathway/network analysis.
5.	Understand how statistical computing approaches can be used to integrate and visualize complex data.
6.	Understand basic biological concepts and techniques in functional genomics.

**Course Requirements:**
1.  Attendance in class sessions.
2.  Participation in discussions and in-class computer exercises.
3.  Reading assignments, completed before class.
4.  Completion of *On Your Own* content and computer exercises.
5.  Completion of final project proposal, report, and presentation.

**Grading Summary:**
* 40% attendance and participation in exercises and discussion
* 25% completion of assignments
* 5% final project proposal
* 15% final project report (including code)
* 15% final project presentation
