Welcome to MCB 585! This course is offered by the Molecular & Cellular Biology Department at the University of Arizona. 

MCB585 is an advanced graduate course focused on quantitative approaches to biological questions. Students will learn how to acquire, access, and interact with large biological datasets. The first part of the course relies heavily on learning and utilizing the R Statistical Programming language, but students are not expected to have programing experience upon entering the course. The Fall 2024 course is broken up into two units. The first unit will focus on introducing R and using R in basic statistical operations. This section incorporates elements of experimental design and appropriate application of statistical tests as a frame for learning R.  The second section focuses on extracting and analyzing quantitative information from image data. 

**Instructors:**

*   **George Sutphin**, Assistant Professor, Molecule & Cellular Biology
*   **Andrew Paek**, Associate Professor, Molecule & Cellular Biology

**Course Goals:**

Students will be able to:
1.	Use the R programing environment to approach basic problems in biological sciences.
2.	Apply basic biostatistics methods, such as selecting and employing an appropriate statistical test and conducting a power analysis based on preliminary data.
3.	Access, manipulate, and analyze large biological datasets.
4.	Understand how statistical computing approaches can be used to integrate and visualize complex data.
5.	Perform background subtraction, segment, and extract quantitative information from imaging data using MATLAB and Cell Profiler.

**Course Requirements:**
1.  Attendance in class sessions.
2.  Participation in discussions and in-class computer exercises.
3.  Reading assignments, completed before class.
4.  Completion of *On Your Own* content and computer exercises.
5.  Completion of final project.

**Grading Summary:**
* 34% attendance and participation in exercises and discussion
* 33% completion of assignments
* 33% student research final project proposals, report (including code), and presentation
