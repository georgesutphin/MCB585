To participate in both in-class exercises and homework, you will need access to a computer with the current versions of the following installed:

1. the [R software](https://www.r-project.org/) itself, and
1. [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

You also need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `MCB585`.
2. Download [MCB585-sample-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/MCB585-sample-data.zip)
   and move the file to this folder.
3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up
   with a new folder called `data`.
4. You can access this folder through your systems file explorer, or by using command-prompt navigation with:

**Unix shell:** 
~~~
$ ls
$ cd Desktop/MCB585/data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

**Windows Command Prompt:** 
~~~
> dir
> cd C:\Users\<user>\OneDrive\Desktop\MCB585\data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

**MacOS** 
~~~
$ cd /Users/<username>/Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}
